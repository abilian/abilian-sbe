About
=====

Abilian SBE (Social Business Engine) is a platform for developing social business applications, and more specifically collaborative / enterprise 2.0 business applications, such as enterprise social networks (ESN).

It is based on the `Abilian Core <http://abilian-core.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ project which provide the basic services, on top of Flask and SQLAlchemy.

Abilian SBE adds the concept of *communities*, which are collaborative spaces with services such as lightweight document management, discussions, wikis, user timelines.

Abilian SBE is currently alpha software and evolving quickly. OTOH, it's already used by several major customers in production, since mid 2013.

Install
=======

Prerequisites (native dependencies)
-----------------------------------

- Python 2.7, ``virtualenv``, ``pip``
- `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_
- Sqlite, or a postgresql database.
- A few image manipulation libraries (``libpng``, ``libjpeg``...)
- ``poppler-utils``, ``unoconv``, ``LibreOffice``, ``ImageMagick``.
- `{Less} <http://lesscss.org/>`__ css pre-processor
- A Java environment (JRE 1.7 for example). The `closure compiler
  <https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/>`_ is used for minifying
  javascript files. You don't have to install the compiler yourself, but a Java
  environment is required.

Get a working application
-------------------------

The following commands will create a virtualenv for the application,
install a script named ``abilian_sbe``, launch development server and
open a setupwizard in your browser:

.. code:: bash

    $ virtualenv sbe
    $ cd sbe; source bin/activate
    $ pip install -U setuptools pip
    $ pip install abilian-sbe
    $ python -m abilian.sbe.app setup_sbe_app

MAC OS + Homebrew
-----------------

You will need to install the following packages using homebrew
(**before** running ``pip install ...``):

::

    brew install python2.7 jpeg git libmagic poppler imagemagick

Running with gunicorn
---------------------

.. code:: bash

    gunicorn 'abilian.sbe.app.create_app()'


Developing
==========

Branching policy
----------------

We currently have two branches:

- `master` for stable version (0.3.x)
- `develop` for next version (0.4.devx)

Testing
-------

Short test
~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure all the dependencies are installed (cf. above), then run ``make
test``.

With coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run ``make test-with-coverage``.

Full test suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install `tox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_. Run ``tox -e ALL``.

2 environments are available:

- ``py27``: uses in-memory sqlite
- ``py27_postgres``: uses local postgresql server (you need to first create a
   database, and user/password; tox uses environment variables
   ``POSTGRES_HOST``, ``POSTGRES_PORT``, ``POSTGRES_DB``, ``POSTGRES_USER``,
   ``POSTGRES_PASSWORD``)

Build Status
------------

The project is under continuous integration with Travis and CircleCI:

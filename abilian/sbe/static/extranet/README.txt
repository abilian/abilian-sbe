Put Abilian specific code here.

TODO: actually this is a bit more complicated.

We should have:

- folders for assets that are just copied from existing libraries (jQuery, Bootstrap, select2...)

- folders for assets that are specific to Abilian components / libraries.
  They should actually be provided somehow and not appear at all here.

- a folder for project specific customisations.
